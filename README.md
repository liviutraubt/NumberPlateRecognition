🚗 Number Plate Recognition with OpenCV
This project is the final assignment for my Image Processing class. It is a simple and effective number plate recognition system built using C++ and OpenCV. The application processes input images to detect and extract number plates from vehicles.

📷 Features
Load and process vehicle images

Detect number plates using image processing techniques

Extract and highlight the detected plate region

Prepares region of interest (ROI) for further OCR (not included)

🔧 Technologies
C++

OpenCV (image preprocessing, contour detection, etc.)

🧠 Techniques Used
Grayscale conversion

Noise reduction and edge detection (Gaussian blur, Canny)

Morphological operations

Contour detection and filtering

Plate region extraction based on aspect ratio and size
