# 🚗 Number Plate Recognition with OpenCV

This project is the final assignment for my Image Processing class. It is a simple and effective number plate recognition system built using **C++** and **OpenCV**. The application processes input images to detect and extract number plates from vehicles.

## 📷 Features

- Load and process vehicle images
- Detect number plates using image processing techniques
- Extract and highlight the detected plate region
- Prepares region of interest (ROI) for further OCR (not included)

## 🔧 Technologies

- **C++**
- **OpenCV** (image preprocessing, contour detection, etc.)

## 🧠 Techniques Used

- Grayscale conversion
- Noise reduction and edge detection (Gaussian blur, Canny)
- Morphological operations
- Contour detection and filtering
- Plate region extraction based on aspect ratio and size

## 📁 How to Use

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/number-plate-recognition-opencv.git
